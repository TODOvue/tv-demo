# Changelog

All notable changes to `@todovue/tv-demo` will be documented in this file.

---
## [1.0.4] - 2025-09-05

### üõ†Ô∏è Changed
- Fixed the library entry point in `vite.config.js` to point to `src/entry.ts` instead of the `.vue` file. This resolves the default import error from Vue (`No matching export in "vue" for import "default"`) and ensures full compatibility with Vue 3 in both SPA and SSR (Nuxt 3).

---
## [1.0.3] - 2025-09-05

### ‚ú® Added
- SSR (Server Side Rendering) compatibility: the component can now be used seamlessly in Nuxt 3 and other SSR frameworks.
- Automatic import of all required CSS (global styles and highlight.js) when importing the component, so no manual CSS import is needed in SPA or SSR environments.
- Improved documentation and usage examples for both SPA and SSR (Nuxt 3) in the README.

### üõ†Ô∏è Changed
- Refactored `entry.ts` to ensure styles are always loaded and the component is exportable for universal usage.
- README and changelog updated to reflect SSR support and new usage patterns.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-05-05

### üêõ Fixed

### üì¶ Dependencies

---
## [1.0.1] - 2025-05-05

### üêõ Fixed
- Improved layout consistency by wrapping the component preview inside `.tv-demo-component-content` with centered `flex` alignment.
